An html5/js game

If you read this conan, fuck you.

For real though here's a little break down

Player is a class, player is the player
Level is a class, level1 is the level you see
same shit for the vertical moving enemy

Basically what I'm looking to do is make a scroller kinda like sonic. But I want to use magnets as a mechanism 
for travel at some point. Like, you pick up or start with magnets, then you have this awesome suit that can charge
positive or negative for a certain amount of time, Then you can throw the magnets and have them attach to the wall
and floor to travel faster/further distances. You can also degauss your suit to eliminate the magnetic effects while
in the field. I'm working on a grappling hook sort of thing that shoots out at a 45 degree angle and will allow you
to swing for better/cooler mobility in situations where you dont have magnets. I haven't though too much about bosses
but the magnets and the suit should come into play.

So yeah. That's my idea kind of. The game isn't much now but it'll get there. It'll get there.
